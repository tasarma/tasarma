- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Mahmut Tasar
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™ve been coding in Python and Typescript for over 3 years.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m learning Rust at the moment.
- ðŸ“« You can follow me on Medium <a href="https://darageoai.medium.com/"> darageoai.medium </a>

I discovered my passion for coding during my bachelor's degree in Geomatics Engineering, where I took my first course in C programming. This foundation inspired me to explore further, and I completed courses in Python, SQL, and Advanced Python during both my bachelor's and master's studies. Later, I stepped into the JavaScript and React.js ecosystem, deepening my expertise in web development.

I'm currently on the look out for a role in Full Stack Development, though I'm open to exploring other opportunities as well. I'd love to work with a tight knit team where I can make an impact quickly. If you're hiring, let's chat!
